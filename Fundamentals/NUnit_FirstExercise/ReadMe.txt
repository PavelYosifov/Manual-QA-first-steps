Welcome to my NUnit test folder! This folder showcases my journey in learning and practicing unit testing using the NUnit framework. Each project within this folder represents a significant step in my progress towards mastering this essential software development technique.

### Project 1: Introduction to Unit Testing

In this initial project, I embarked on my unit testing journey. I familiarized myself with the fundamentals of NUnit and gained a solid understanding of the core concepts, such as test fixtures, test cases, and assertions. I created a variety of basic tests to validate the behavior and correctness of different methods and functions. These tests provided me with a foundation for writing effective and reliable unit tests.

Throughout this NUnit test folder, I document my progress, learnings, and challenges I encounter during my unit testing journey. I hope that my projects serve as a valuable resource for others interested in learning about unit testing and encourage the adoption of this critical development practice.
Feel free to explore each project (for now its only one but expect more in the future), run the tests, and delve into the code to gain insights into my learning process and the concepts I have applied. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy unit testing :) !
